In this assignment, you will use language modeling to detect which of three languages a document is written in. 
You will build unigram, bigram, and trigram letter language models (both unsmoothed and smoothed versions) 
for three languages, score a test document with each, and determine the language it is written in based on perplexity. 
You will use the literature to improve your results with a more sophisticated method for adjusting the counts.
